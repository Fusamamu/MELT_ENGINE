# MELT - 2D Tile-Based Game Engine

MELT is a 2D tile-based game engine designed for creating tile-based games with efficient rendering and entity management. It leverages SDL, OpenGL, GLEW, GLM, and an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture for performance and flexibility.

## Features

- **2D Tile-Based Rendering**: Optimized for rendering large tile maps with minimal overhead.
- **Entity-Component-System (ECS)**: Decouples data and logic for scalable and maintainable game code.
- **OpenGL Rendering**: Utilizes OpenGL for high-performance graphics rendering.
- **SDL Integration**: Handles window management, input, and other system-level operations.
- **GLM for Math**: Leverages GLM for vector and matrix math operations.
- **GLEW for OpenGL Extensions**: Ensures compatibility with various OpenGL versions and extensions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run MELT, you'll need the following:

- **SDL2**: Simple DirectMedia Layer for handling windows, input, and more.
- **GLEW**: OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library for managing OpenGL extensions.
- **GLM**: OpenGL Mathematics library for handling mathematical operations.
- **OpenGL**: A compatible version of OpenGL (preferably 3.3 or higher).
- **C++17**: MELT requires a C++17 compatible compiler.

### Building the Engine

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MELT.git
   cd MELT
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure SDL2, GLEW, and GLM are installed on your system. On Debian-based systems, you can use:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libglew-dev libglm-dev
   ```

3. **Build the Engine:**
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

4. **Run the Engine:**
   ```bash
   ./MELT
   ```

### Usage

MELT is designed to be highly customizable. You can start by creating your own game scenes, entities, and components.

#### Example Code

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```cpp
#include "MELT.h"

int main() {
    MELT::Engine engine;
    engine.init("My MELT Game", 800, 600);

    // Load your game assets, create entities, etc.

    engine.run();
    engine.cleanup();

    return 0;
}
```

## Documentation

- **API Reference**: Detailed documentation of MELT's API can be found [here](link-to-api-docs).
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides on using MELT for your game projects are available [here](link-to-tutorials).
